    <book_description><![CDATA[Khaled Hosseini's #1 New York Times Bestselling Debut<br><br><i> “It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime." </i><br><br>Amir is the son of a wealthy Kabul merchant, a member of the ruling caste of Pashtuns. Hassan, his servant and constant companion, is a Hazara, a despised and impoverished caste. Their uncommon bond is torn by Amir's choice to abandon his friend amidst the increasing ethnic, religious, and political tensions of the dying years of the Afghan monarchy, wrenching them far apart. But so strong is the bond between the two boys that Amir journeys back to a distant world, to try to right past wrongs against the only true friend he ever had.<br><br>The unforgettable, heartbreaking story of the unlikely friendship between a wealthy boy and the son of his father’s servant, <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a beautifully crafted novel set in a country that is in the process of being destroyed. It is about the power of reading, the price of betrayal, and the possibility of redemption; and an exploration of the power of fathers over sons—their love, their sacrifices, their lies.<br><br>A sweeping story of family, love, and friendship told against the devastating backdrop of the history of Afghanistan over the last thirty years, <i>The Kite Runner</i> is an unusual and powerful novel that has become a beloved, one-of-a-kind classic.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>NOW THE ACCLAIMED HBO SERIES <i>GAME OF THRONES</i></b><br><br>From a master of contemporary fantasy comes the first novel of a landmark series unlike any you’ve ever read before. With <i>A Game of Thrones, </i>George R. R. Martin has launched a genuine masterpiece, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill the pages of this magnificent saga, the first volume in an epic series sure to delight fantasy fans everywhere.<br><b> </b><br><b>A GAME OF THRONES</b><br><b>A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE: BOOK ONE</b><br> <br>Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.<br><br>Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.<br><br>Unparalleled in scope and execution, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is one of those rare reading experiences that catch you up from the opening pages, won’t let you go until the end, and leave you yearning for more.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Journeys to the end of the world, fantastic creatures, and epic battles between good and evil—what more could any reader ask for in one book? The book that has it all is <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i>, written in 1949 by Clive Stables Lewis. But Lewis did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together they became known as <i>The Chronicles of Narnia.</i><br><br>For the past fifty years, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations.<br><br>This edition presents all seven books—unabridged—in one impressive volume. The books are presented here in chronlogical order, each chapter graced with an illustration by the original artist, Pauline Baynes. Deceptively simple and direct, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> continue to captivate fans with adventures, characters, and truths that speak to readers of all ages, even fifty years after they were first published.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Millions of readers have discovered the magic of David Eddings' "New""York Times" bestselling series "The Belgariad." Now the first three books in this monumental epic appear in a single volume. Here, long-time fans can rediscover the wonder--and the uninitiated can embark upon a thrilling new journey of fantasy and adventure. <br>It all begins with the theft of the Orb that for so long protected the West from an evil god. As long as the Orb was at Riva, the prophecy went, its people would be safe from this corrupting power. Garion, a simple farm boy, is familiar with the legend of the Orb, but skeptical in matters of magic. Until, through a twist of fate, he learns not only that the story of the Orb is true, but that he must set out on a quest of unparalleled magic and danger to help recover it. For Garion is a child of destiny, and fate itself is leading him far from his home, sweeping him irrevocably toward a distant tower--and a cataclysmic confrontation with a master of the darkest magic.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A fantastic starter set for new Tolkien fans or readers interested in rediscovering the magic of Middle-earth, this three-volume box set features paperback editions of the complete trilogy -- <i>The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers,</i> and <i>The Return of the King</i> -- each with art from the New Line Productions feature film on the cover.<br>J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy is a genuine masterpiece. The most widely read and influential fantasy epic of all time, it is also quite simply one of the most memorable and beloved tales ever told. Originally published in 1954, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> set the framework upon which all epic/quest fantasy since has been built. Through the urgings of the enigmatic wizard Gandalf, young hobbit Frodo Baggins embarks on an urgent, incredibly treacherous journey to destroy the One Ring. This ring -- created and then lost by the Dark Lord, Sauron, centuries earlier -- is a weapon of evil, one that Sauron desperately wants returned to him. With the power of the ring once again his own, the Dark Lord will unleash his wrath upon all of Middle-earth. The only way to prevent this horrible fate from becoming reality is to return the Ring to Mordor, the only place it can be destroyed. Unfortunately for our heroes, Mordor is also Sauron's lair. <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy is essential reading not only for fans of fantasy but for lovers of classic literature as well...<br><br><i>Librarian's note: this edition shares an ISBN with the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18190993-the-lord-of-the-rings">2004 edition</a> published by Houghton Mifflin Company</i>]]></book_description>

This is where it all begins -- with the tourist Twoflower and his wizard guide, Rincewind.<br><br><i>On a world supported on the back of a giant turtle (sex unknown), a gleeful, explosive, wickedly eccentric expedition sets out. There's an avaricious but inept wizard, a naive tourist whose luggage moves on hundreds of dear little legs, dragons who only exist if you believe in them, and of course THE EDGE of the planet...</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<p>Beginning with a short story appearing in <i>The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</i> in 1978, the publication of Stephen King's epic work of fantasy -- what he considers to be a single long novel and his magnum opus -- has spanned a quarter of a century.</p><p>Set in a world of extraordinary circumstances, filled with stunning visual imagery and unforgettable characters, <i>The Dark Tower</i> series is King's most visionary feat of storytelling, a magical mix of science fiction, fantasy, and horror that may well be his crowning achievement.</p><p><b>Book I</b><br>In <i>The Gunslinger</i> (originally published in 1982), King introduces his most enigmatic hero, Roland Deschain of Gilead, the Last Gunslinger. He is a haunting, solitary figure at first, on a mysterious quest through a desolate world that eerily mirrors our own. Pursuing the man in black, an evil being who can bring the dead back to life, Roland is a good man who seems to leave nothing but death in his wake.</p><p>This new edition of <i>The Gunslinger</i> has been revised and expanded throughout by King, with new story material, in addition to a new introduction and foreword. It also includes four full-color illustrations in the hardcover and trade paperback formats.</p>]]></book_description>

Animals and plants retract; cities are built in shelter. In centuries since ten orders of Knights fell, their Shardblade swords and Shardplate armor still transform men into near-invincible warriors. Wars are fought for them, and won by them.<br><br>In one such war on ruined Shattered Plains, slave Kaladin struggles to save his men and fathom leaders who deem them expendable, in senseless wars where ten armies fight separately against one foe. <br><br>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Fascinated by ancient text <i>The Way of Kings</i>, troubled by visions of ancient times, he doubts his sanity.<br><br>Across the ocean, Shallan trains under eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar’s niece Jasnah. Though Shallan genuinely loves learning, she plans a daring theft. Her research hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder― much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing―not even a smear of blood―to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?<br><br>This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know... <br><br>Exotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Percy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or control his temper. And lately, being away at boarding school is only getting worse—Percy could have sworn his pre-algebra teacher turned into a monster and tried to kill him. When Percy's mom finds out, she knows it's time that he knew the truth about where he came from, and that he go to the one place he'll be safe. She sends Percy to Camp Half Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island), where he learns that the father he never knew is Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon a mystery unfolds and together with his friends—one a satyr and the other the demigod daughter of Athena—Percy sets out on a quest across the United States to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In an epic trilogy, Philip Pullman unlocks the door to a world parallel to our own, but with a mysterious slant all its own. D?mons and winged creatures live side by side with humans, and a mysterious entity called Dust just might have the power to unite the universes--if it isn't destroyed first. Here, the three paperback titles in Pullman's heroic fantasy series are united in one dazzling boxed set. Join Lyra, Pantalaimon, Will, and the rest as they embark on the most breathtaking, heartbreaking adventures of their lives. The fate of the universe is in their hands.

This is a world in which science, theology and magic are closely intertwined.The Subtle Knife is the second part of the trilogy that began with The Golden Compass. That first book was set in a world like ours, but different. This book begins in our own world.In The Subtle Knife, readers are introduced to Will Parry, a young boy living in modern-day Oxford, England.
